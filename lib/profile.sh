# Device profile parser and the trust tiers that decide what an installer is
# allowed to do. Source this, do not execute it.
#
# A profile is strict key=value, in a base block followed by one or more board
# sections. It is PARSED, never sourced: profiles arrive through issues from
# people we do not know, and `source`-ing one would be arbitrary code execution
# as root.
#
# Comments are whole lines beginning with '#'. There are no inline comments, so
# a '#' inside a value is just a character.
#
# --- why there are sections ---------------------------------------------------
#
# HONOR sells one product code as several machines. ZQC-P is board M1010 with a
# Core Ultra X9 388H here, and board M1050 with a Core Ultra 5 338H in the
# report on issue #1. Same sys_vendor, same product_name, different silicon.
#
# The old format had one flat block per product, so `status=verified` and every
# constant measured on M1010 applied to every ZQC-P that ever boots this
# repository, M1050 included. board_version was recorded but only ever consulted
# to break a tie between two candidate files, which on a product with a single
# file never happened.
#
# So the unit of trust is the board revision, and that is what a section is.
# Everything that can differ between revisions lives in one, including status.
# The base block holds only what identifies the product itself.
#
#   model=ZQC-P
#   dmi_vendor=HONOR
#   dmi_product=ZQC-P
#
#   [board M1010]
#   status=verified
#   platform=pantherlake
#   param_backlight_min=12
#   fixes=...
#
#   [board M1050]
#   status=reported
#   ...
#
# A section header may name several revisions that are the same machine,
# `[board M1110 M1120]`, and `[board *]` is an explicit catch-all for revisions
# of this product that have no section of their own.
#
# A machine whose board_version matches no section and where the profile has no
# `[board *]` gets the base block with status forced down to `probed`. It is
# never refused outright, because the tier A fixes derive their own inputs and
# are worth having, and it never inherits `verified`, because nobody measured
# that revision. See profile_select_board.

# The base block holds these and nothing else: what identifies the product, and
# what selects the file in the first place. A section that set dmi_product would
# describe a different product and belongs in its own file.
#
# The converse is the point of the format. Every other key is a reading, a
# measurement or a decision about one board revision, so it has to be claimed by
# a section. That is enforced, not merely documented: allowing a hardware id or
# a status in the base block is what let a value measured on M1010 apply to

# nothing while it did: the duplicate-revision check compares every header
# against every earlier one, so the cost is quadratic. The largest real profile
# has five sections and the longest real value is under a hundred characters, so
# these caps are far above anything legitimate and turn a hang into a sentence.

# --- trust tiers --------------------------------------------------------------
# A  Derives its inputs from the running machine, or matches on a device id and
#    simply finds nothing on hardware it was not meant for. Safe to offer on a
#    profile nobody has verified.
# B  Carries model specific constants. Getting them wrong misconfigures real
#    hardware, so these need status=verified.
# C  Installs a binary taken from one machine's firmware, with no way to check
#    at run time that it belongs there.
#
# oled-backlight looks like tier A because it reads the VBT off the running
# machine, but backlight_min was measured on one panel. Until somebody measures
# it on theirs it is tier B.
#
# acpi-override is tier A, which needs explaining because it installs firmware.
# It does not decide from the profile. Before installing anything it finds the
# live table by its OEM table id and compares the md5 against the stock table
# this repository carries, and refuses unless they are equal. That is a direct
# measurement of the running machine and it is strictly stronger than asking
# which model this is: the I2C_DEVT table turns out to be byte-identical between
# ZQC-P and XWC-P, so the model was never the thing that mattered. A profile
# still has to list the fix for it to run at all.
# -g because this file may be sourced from inside a function, where a plain
