#!/usr/bin/env bash
# install.sh — rebuild xe.ko so the driver reaches for DSC instead of driving
# the internal panel below 8 bits per colour.
#
# intel_dp_compute_link_config_wide() is allowed to give up colour depth to
# make a mode fit, down to 6 bpc for RGB, and compression is only considered
# after that search fails. On this machine the search does not fail: the panel
# is 3120x2080 at 120 Hz, its DPCD offers no link rate above HBR2, and 6 bpc
# with dithering is the best that fits uncompressed. The panel supports DSC,
# the firmware does not forbid it, and nothing ever asks. See README.md.
#
# The module is shared with the other xe fixes in this repository, so the
# actual build lives in lib/xe-build.sh and always carries the full set.
#
# Env knobs are the builder's: KVER, JOBS, WORKDIR, KEEP_SRC, REGEN, FORCE.

Reboot, then check:

    sudo grep -E 'pipe src=' /sys/kernel/debug/dri/*/i915_display_info
        expect: dither=no, bpp=30 on a 10-bit panel

    sudo grep DSC_Enabled /sys/kernel/debug/dri/*/eDP-1/i915_dsc_fec_support
        expect: yes

If the panel comes up wrong, boot the other kernel entry in your bootloader:
the module overlay is per kernel version, so a second installed kernel is
unaffected by this. uninstall_patch.sh removes the overlay.
