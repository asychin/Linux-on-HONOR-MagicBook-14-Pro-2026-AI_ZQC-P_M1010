# Microphone mutes itself, mic-mute LED flickers

| Survives kernel updates | Yes, nothing to rebuild |

```sh
sudo bash patch/micmute/install.sh
```

## Symptom

The microphone mutes and unmutes on its own, the `platform::micmute` LED
flickers, notifications repeat, and the mic often ends up stuck muted with
Fn+F7 unable to recover it.

It starts only after the SSDT27 override in [`../acpi-override/`](../acpi-override/)
is applied, because that is what makes the I²C touch controllers enumerate.
Reported independently on the sibling FMB-P and on a U5 338H variant.

## Cause

The touchscreen is a FocalTech **FTSC1000**, I²C HID `2808:5662`. Its report
descriptor contains a vendor-defined collection:

```
Usage Page (0xff01)
Usage (0x01)
Collection (Application)
    Report ID (0x10)
    Report Size (8)
    Report Count (0x3b)      59 bytes of raw data
    Usage (0x01)
    Input (Data,Var,Abs)
End Collection
```

Usage page `0xff01` is `HID_UP_HPVENDOR2` in `include/linux/hid.h`, the page HP
uses for hotkey buttons. `drivers/hid/hid-input.c` maps it with no vendor
check:

```c
	case HID_UP_HPVENDOR2:
		set_bit(EV_REP, input->evbit);
		switch (usage->hid & HID_USAGE) {
		case 0x001: map_key_clear(KEY_MICMUTE);		break;
```

Three things compound from there:

| Step | Effect |
|---|---|
| Device matches `MT_CLS_WIN_8`, which sets `export_all_inputs` | `hid-multitouch` does not filter the collection out |
| `HID_QUIRK_INPUT_PER_APP` | the collection gets its own input device, `FTSC1000:00 2808:5662 UNKNOWN`, whose only capability is `KEY_MICMUTE` |
| All 59 bytes carry the same usage, 8 bits wide, logical range 0..255, and the same code path sets `EV_REP` | any non-zero byte is a key press, and one report leaves the key held down and auto-repeating |

### Measured

```
$ cat /proc/bus/input/devices
I: Bus=0018 Vendor=2808 Product=5662 Version=0100
N: Name="FTSC1000:00 2808:5662 UNKNOWN"
H: Handlers=kbd event6
B: KEY=100000000000000 0 0 0        bit 248 only = KEY_MICMUTE

$ sudo evtest /dev/input/event6
12:14:00.736 type=1 code=248 value=2
12:14:00.770 type=1 code=248 value=2
12:14:00.804 type=1 code=248 value=2
```

29 `KEY_MICMUTE` autorepeat events per second, continuously, 8.5 hours into an
uptime, with nobody touching the machine.

- `EVIOCGKEY` confirmed the key was stuck in the pressed state.
- `EVIOCGKEYCODE` confirmed the mapping: `scancode 0xff010001 -> keycode 248`.

Compositors drop most autorepeats, so the mic does not toggle thirty times a
second. What is visible are the press/release edges: each time a vendor report
goes zero → non-zero → zero the mute toggles once, and whichever toggle the
desktop loses to a race leaves the mic muted.

## Fix

`honor-ftsc1000-micmute.bpf.c` is a HID-BPF `rdesc_fixup` program. It walks the
report descriptor before the kernel parses it and applies one rule:

> A hotkey is either a single bit of a button bitmap or an entry of a usage
> array, never a multi-bit variable data field.

That is the same test `hid-input` already uses in its own `unknown:` fallback.
Where a wide variable field is found on page `0xff01`, the usage page item is
rewritten `0xff01 → 0xff00`. `0xff00` is `HID_UP_MSVENDOR`, which `hid-input`
ignores outright, so no input device is created for the collection.

The digitizer collections carry their own usage pages and are untouched.

`install.sh` fetches the kernel's BPF prog headers for the running kernel's
tag, generates `vmlinux.h` from `/sys/kernel/btf/vmlinux`, builds the object
with clang, and installs it through `udev-hid-bpf`:

```
/etc/udev-hid-bpf/honor-ftsc1000-micmute.bpf.o
/etc/udev/rules.d/99-hid-bpf-honor-ftsc1000-micmute.rules
```

The udev rule matches `hid:b0018g0004v00002808p00005662` and loads the program
on device add. The object is CO-RE, so kernel updates need no rebuild.

### Verified after installing

| Check | Result |
|---|---|
| `... UNKNOWN` input device | gone |
| `KEY_MICMUTE` events from HID | zero |
| Touchscreen (`event5`, multitouch + `BTN_TOUCH`) | works |
| Touchpad (`TOPS0102`, also `hid-multitouch`) | works |
| `Huawei WMI hotkeys` keycode 248 | still present, real Fn+F7 unaffected |

The real Fn+F7 arrives over WMI as scancode `0x287 → keycode 248`, never over
HID, so it is on a completely separate path.

### Uninstall

```sh
sudo rm /etc/udev-hid-bpf/honor-ftsc1000-micmute.bpf.o \
        /etc/udev/rules.d/99-hid-bpf-honor-ftsc1000-micmute.rules
sudo udevadm control --reload
reboot
```

## Why HID-BPF and not a kernel patch

The bug is in `hid-input.c`, and the natural fix is to guard the
`HID_UP_HPVENDOR2` case:

```c
	case HID_UP_HPVENDOR2:
		if ((field->flags & HID_MAIN_ITEM_VARIABLE) &&
		    field->report_size != 1)
			goto ignore;
		set_bit(EV_REP, input->evbit);
```

`hid-input.c` is part of `hid.ko`, and CachyOS builds it with `CONFIG_HID=y`, so
it cannot be replaced with a module overlay. Deploying that patch means
rebuilding the kernel package after every update. HID-BPF applies the identical
rule at the descriptor level, needs no rebuild, and is the kernel's own
mechanism for this class of problem.

## Ruled out

| Approach | Why it fails |
|---|---|
| `udev` hwdb `KEYBOARD_KEY_ff010001=reserved` | `hidinput_setkeycode()` remaps only the *first* usage matching a scancode, then re-sets the capability bit because the other 58 still map to 248. Tested live, no change |
| `LIBINPUT_IGNORE_DEVICE` udev rule (used by the FMB-P port) | works for libinput consumers only; the kernel still creates the device, holds the key down and burns ~30 timer wakeups per second |
| Rebuilt `hid-multitouch.ko` refusing to export vendor collections | works, but is the wrong layer and has to be rebuilt after every kernel update |
| SSDT override of `_Q14`, WMI `SMLS`, the `WMAA` dispatcher | all belong to the legitimate Fn+F7 path and have nothing to do with the phantom key |

## Earlier diagnosis, now withdrawn

This was previously attributed to the EC firmware firing WMI event `0x287` on
its own, and mitigated by a storm filter in `huawei-wmi`. The evidence was
bursts of `atkbd ... code 0xf8` in `dmesg`, but that line is emitted for every
genuine Fn+F7 press too, including the repeated presses made while fighting the
flicker, so the count conflated deliberate presses with spurious events. The
`_Q14 → WMI 0x287 → KEY_MICMUTE` chain is real and is how the key works; the EC
was never shown to fire it unprompted. The filter has been removed from this
repository.

## Which machines this device is on

`2808:5662` is not unique to the reference machine. It is confirmed on four
HONOR models, and all four profiles list this fix:

| Model | Evidence |
|---|---|
| `ZQC-P` | measured here, with the symptom |
| `FMB-P` | colorcube issue #5, same symptom |
| `MRA-XXX` | [probe 35a02e8c69](https://linux-hardware.org/?probe=35a02e8c69), same `FTSC1000` ACPI name and ids |
| `MRB-XXX` | [probe 69946861f1](https://linux-hardware.org/?probe=69946861f1&log=input_devices), the same |

Only the first two have the symptom reported. The other two are listed because
the fix binds to that one HID id and rewrites that one report descriptor: on a
unit without the part it matches nothing and does nothing, so listing it costs
nothing and being wrong is cheap. Ten `FMB-P` hardware probes show no
touchscreen at all, so that model evidently ships in more than one
configuration, which is the same argument from the other direction.

If you have an Art 14 and the microphone does **not** mute itself, say so and
it comes off those two profiles.

**It does not cover the other phantom-key source on `FMB-P`.** That machine has
two: this touchscreen, and separately a Goodix `27c6:01e0` touchpad whose
`FF00:0001` and `FF01:0001` vendor collections `hid-input` also maps into a
phantom `UNKNOWN` device (colorcube issue #3, kernel bugzilla 220741). Anybody
extending this fix to that part needs a second program bound to that id — and
should note it is the mirror image of
[`../touchpad-edge/`](../touchpad-edge/), where the same vendor collections on
the same vendor's silicon carry a gesture worth keeping rather than noise worth
dropping.

## This would be the first HONOR program upstream

`drivers/hid/bpf/progs/` in mainline holds thirty vendor programs — Huion,
XPPen, Wacom, TUXEDO, Rapoo, Microsoft, Logitech and others — plus
`Generic__touchpad.bpf.c`, and **nothing for HONOR**. Both HID-BPF programs in
this repository, this one and the touchpad-edge translator, are exactly the
shape that directory takes. Neither has been submitted.

## Layout: one directory per machine

```
patch/micmute/
    install.sh
    hid-bpf-reapply.sh          the boot-time re-apply, no ids in it
    honor-hid-bpf-reapply.service
    zqc-p/
        M1010/
            recipe.conf
            honor-ftsc1000-micmute.bpf.c
        M1050/
            recipe.conf         same_as=zqc-p/M1010
```

The `<model>/<board>` layout, `same_as`, `any`, and how to add a machine are
the same for every fix and are described once, in
[`../README.md`](../README.md#layout).

What is specific to this one: the fixup rewrites usage page `0xff01` where one
chip's report descriptor uses it for a wide variable field. That is a statement
about that chip, not about a laptop, so it cannot be widened by editing a match.
A machine with a different touchscreen needs its own program, and that program
has to be named `honor-<chip>-micmute.bpf.c`, which is how `uninstall_patch.sh`
finds the object it produced. It is compiled with `-DHID_VID` and `-DHID_PID`
taken from the id found on the bus, so use those names and keep `#ifndef`
fallbacks so it still builds by hand.

`tools/selftest.sh` checks the naming, that the recipe names a file that exists,
and that no device id has been written into anything installed.
