#!/usr/bin/env bash
# install.sh — raise the OLED minimum backlight level by feeding the display
# driver a patched VBT.
#
# Background:
#   intel_backlight does not pass the sysfs value to the hardware. i915/xe map
#   the user range [0..max_brightness] onto [pwm_level_min..pwm_level_max], and
#   pwm_level_min comes from the VBT:
#
#       pwm_level_min = scale(vbt.backlight.min_brightness, 0, 255, 0, pwm_max)
#
#   On this machine the VBT declares 6/255, which lands on 17/704 = 2.4% PWM
#   duty. That is the floor the firmware considers acceptable, and this panel
#   does not render it evenly: at that duty the OLED shows a colour cast and
#   visible blotches. "0%" in any desktop environment lands exactly there.
#
#   Raising that one value fixes two things at once. The floor moves up out of
#   the ugly region, and the whole slider is rescaled rather than clipped, so
#   the first brightness step stops tripling the light output (2.41% -> 7.24%
#   at the factory floor).
#
#   The driver takes a VBT from a file when told to, validates the signature
#   and the sizes, and falls back to the firmware's own copy on any failure.
#   Worst case is therefore stock behaviour, not a dark screen.
#
# The blob is extracted from this machine at install time and patched in place.
# Nothing panel-specific is shipped in the repository, because the VBT belongs
# to the BIOS revision of the unit it came from.
#
# Usage:
#   sudo bash install.sh                # uses VBT_MIN below
#   sudo VBT_MIN=20 bash install.sh     # after running measure-floor.sh
#
# Reruns are safe and always patch from the saved factory copy, so changing
# VBT_MIN and re-running does the right thing.

Do NOT check /sys/kernel/debug/dri/0/i915_vbt. That node re-runs
request_firmware() when you read it, so it reports the file on disk rather than
what the driver parsed at boot. See README.

To change the level, re-run with a different VBT_MIN. To revert entirely, run
uninstall.sh in this directory.

If a BIOS update changes the VBT, the installed blob goes stale. This one was
built against BIOS $BIOS; re-run install.sh after any firmware update.
